# FAQ

## Let's get started

### 1. What is PollinationX?

PollinationX is a decentralized storage infra layer that provides developers access to custom decentralized storage nodes and offers end-users dynamic NFTs with preset storage and bandwidth capacities.

### 2. Why is decentralized storage important?

Compared with centralized storage, geographically dispersed decentralized storage network has no single point of failure. Your data is broken into 1000s of pieces and dispersed through the network decentralized storage nodes. Access is permissionless, while data retrieval is possible only with the users private key.&#x20;

### 3. Is decentralized storage free?

PollinationX offers first 100MB of decentralized storage and 25 Bandwidth for free. Users can upgrade their storage using [PX sNFTs](../overview/px-storage-nft.md) available in various sizes (e.g. 5GB, 10GB, 20GB, 100GB). If compared with centralized storage solutions, one must acknowledge that some storage plans could offer "free" packages in exchange for associated users data, which is mined and sold. This is not the case with PollinationX.&#x20;

## Data security and privacy

### 4. Is data ownership preserved?

Yes, compared to centralized storage where users don't have control over their data, decentralized storage enables full data custody while retaining data ownership.&#x20;

### 5. Who can access the data?

Data can be accessed only with the users private key!

### 6. Can I delete my data from PX Drive?

You can delete files from your PX Drive account. Simply connect to your PX Drive account and use the delete function in the file manager. This will remove the files from your account, but they will still remain on the decentralized storage network.

However, once a file is uploaded to decentralized storage, there cannot be a guarantee that all copies of the file are gone from the decentralized storage network. As soon as a file is uploaded, other decentralized storage nodes can access and store a copy of the data. The data only becomes unavailable when the last decentralized storage node has stopped pinning the file, and all copies are garbage collected.&#x20;

## Other

### What is the PX sNFT?

PX Storage NFT is a dynamic NFT programmed with a predetermined storage capacity. It represent the decentralized storage unit (e.g. 5GB, 10GB, 20GB, 100GB) and enable users to mint the storage according to specific needs. The PX sNFT is based on the open-source `[PX]` smart contract.

### What is bandwidth?&#x20;

Bandwidth Defines how many data files can be uploaded to decentralized storage. It acts as a metric used within the PX Storage NFT mechanics (i.e. 1 bandwidth = 1 data file upload).

### What is PX dApp?

PX app is a decentralized application, a developer dashboard and an end-user file hosting service. It is built to service developers while managing subscriptions or accessing a range of developer settings and tools. It is also built for end-users. It offers a file hosting service with cutting-edge decentralized storage solutions that empower users with full control and ownership of their data. \
