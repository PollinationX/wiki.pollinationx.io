# PX Drive

PX Drive is a decentralized storage-based service that enables users to store and access files online in a self-custodial and permissionless way. The service syncs stored documents, photos and more across all the user's devices, that support Web3 wallets.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Built based on decentralized principles;**

(1) Web3 decentralized storage service that is self-custodial, censorship-resistant, de-platforming resistant and permissionless; \
(2) no data mining;\
(3) data access possible only with users' private key; \
(4) self-client custody (e.g. in the case of dApp downtime, the open-source UI client is available); \
(5) multi-chain interoperable (i.e. available on Sepolia, Polygon and Abritrum with many more L1s and L2s coming); \
(6) storage unit based on PX sNFTs.&#x20;
