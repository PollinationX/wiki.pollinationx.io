# PX dApp

The PX dApp is built to service developers while managing subscriptions or accessing a range of developer settings and tools. It is also built for end-users like you and me. It offers a file hosting service with cutting-edge decentralized storage solutions that empower users with full control and ownership of their data. Through dynamic Storage NFTs, users can securely manage their storage quotas and bandwidth capacities. The app provides a familiar "Cloud Storage" experience, syncing files across devices in a self-custodial, permissionless manner, ensuring that your digital assets remain private and secure across all platforms, accessible only to the private key owner.

* **End-users:** A decentralized storage service offering a "Cloud Storage Drive" experience, where users can store and access files online in a self-custodial, permissionless way. It syncs documents, photos, and more across all devices supporting Web3 wallets.
* **Developers:** A integrator-focused dashboard that allows developers to manage their PX subscriptions and access a range of developer settings and tools.
